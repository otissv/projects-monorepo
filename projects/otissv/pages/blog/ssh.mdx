# ssh

SSH stands for Secure Shell, and it’s a network protocol
used to establish a secure connection between two computers
over an unsecured network, like the internet.

When you use SSH, you’re creating a secure, encrypted
connection between your computer and the remote computer
you’re connecting to. This means that any data you send or
receive is protected from eavesdropping or tampering by unauthorized parties.

SSH is often used by system administrators and developers
to remotely access and manage servers and other networked
devices. It allows them to securely execute commands,
transfer files, and perform other tasks on a remote system,
as if they were sitting right in front of it.

## Installing SSH

1. From the command line, type: ssh-keygen
2. Press enter to accept the default location
3. Press enter to accept the default file name

Your public key is now located at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
